# Introduction

In today's digital era, the widespread use of mobile communication has led to an increase in unsolicited and malicious messages, commonly referred to as spam. These spam messages can range from harmless advertisements to fraudulent schemes, posing a significant threat to users. To address this issue, the "SMS Spam Classification" project aims to build a robust machine learning model capable of distinguishing between legitimate (ham) messages and spam.

# Thoughts

The project is simple, we work on some dataset and try to find out what are the trends and what is is the pattern, after finding out the pattern one can get idea of what I've uploaded using the dataset.
Also you explore various dataset on kaggle because this one I've downloaded from there. 
We first do EDA and I have written comments for everything in the jupyter notebook you can refer it. 
After that we checked for various algorithms which gave accuracy and precison score and which was having great score we used that. 
Then we trained the mode and pickled the model and used it.
For the website part I've used streamlit.
